<p>The use of Optical Fiber networks has become a common technology and backbone of most Enterprise networks. This is due to the benefits that come with Optical fiber technology especially to linking the backbone of local area network that can run many meters. Fiber splicing is the method of joining optical fibers cables together to form a single communication link. Splicing is also important for joining the fiber links when they get cut off. Several cores are required for perfect splices individually.</p>

<a id="factors-affecting-splicing-performance" class="anchor" href="#factors-affecting-splicing-performance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Factors affecting splicing performance</h2>

<p>The factors that affect the splicing performance include the core concentrically, the cladding diameter and fiber curls.  Core concentrate is how good the core is placed at the center in the glass cladding region.  The cladding diameter is the outside of the cladding glass region while the last factor, fiber curls refers to the amount of curvature per fixed length of fiber. To avoid these factors, cleaving is important. Cleaving is a deliberate breaking an optical fiber to give it a perfectly flat end face that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the fiber. The other way of avoiding the above factors is by using ODTR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer). Finally, cleaning the dust off the cleave and ensuring that the two optical fibers are of the same make.</p>

<p>Intrinsic factors can be parameters you cannot control. The intrinsic factors affecting the connection performance is the reflection that occurs when light passes between one index of refraction to another like from fiber to air. This causes a small proportion of light is reflected back. Choosing good fiber optics that can withstand shock is the solution to avoiding reflection problem through proper alignment. The use of lenses that can help collimate the and focus light can also help avoid the reflection
The extrinsic factors include the macro-bending and micro-bending which reduces a reduction in the optical power. When there is a bend on an n optical fiber, there occur the strain along the bent region which affects a refractive index and angel of light rays. Macro-bend is a visible bend on a fiber optic. Micro- bend is caused by errors in the cylindrical geometry of the fibers while making in the factory due may be to temperature, tensile forces or crushing forces. Careful selective of the optical fibers is the good to ensure that that optical errors.  There is the minimum bend that fiber cannot be exceeded which should be observed. For large bending, they can be straightened by flattening.
Conclusion
The factors affecting both the splicing performance and connection performance can deteriorate the communication and also the quality fiber optic networks. They can also reduce the speed as well as the amount of lighting signals they can carry.</p>
