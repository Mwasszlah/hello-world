<pre><code>The ruins of the Mexican Temple Mayor remain an importance source of the Aztec ancient history and civilization. The Aztec’s capital had this massive shrine that stood one hundred and fifty feet above the ground, and it served many purposes including preservation of Aztecs culture through great works of arts. The city of Tenochtitlan was established in the 1325 and later expanded in the period between 1325 and 1519. The city’s decline set foot with the attack by the Spaniards to conquer the empire. The Spaniards demolished the Tenochtitlan city and built their own Metropolitan Cathedral of the Assumption of Mary.
The city was destroyed to the ground but upon its discovery by the archeologists, great works of art were recovered including the iconic sunstone (calendar stone), stone sculptures and the Tizoc shrines. The excavations of the Aztec ruins by modern archeologists have revealed culture through the art of the Mesoamerican civilization. It also reveals the Aztecs appreciation and collection of the art.

<p>## The Mexica’s used of visual arts as well as mythical/historical accounts to express the ideological tenets of their empire
    The Mexica expressed every aspect of their culture through art. The Templo Mayor structure and architecture are a manifestation of Mexican mastery in the art, their belief in their different gods and the prosperity in their day to day economic. The greatest of all structures is the pyramid. This pyramid has familiar wide staircases that head to the twin temples above the pyramid. In these two temples are two shrines where the priests offered the human sacrifices to the gods. These gods were the Huitzilopochtli, who was the god of war and the Tlaloc, who was the god of rain. There is a round curved stone at the base of the temple. The stone symbolizes the severed limbs of Aztec moon goddess who was believed to have killed her mother. There are also two snakes that seem to protect the grand staircases. According to the Mexica myth, Templo Mayor symbolized the re-creation of the Coatepec, who people called the “the hill of the serpent.” The sun stone in the temple represented the god of the sun and the warfare, Mexica believed that he had powers to conquer their enemies at war.  According to the mythology, the priest carried the idol of the god Huitzilopochtli during the migration. The idol would whisper to them the directions they should follow. The eagle sitting on a cactus plant was used to symbolize the spot that they were to settle which the city of Tenochtitlan was. It is where the Temple Mayor Museum stands today. The two shrines at the top of the pyramid were used for human sacrifices to the gods.
    ## The building of the Tenochtitlan was done in seven phases of constructions
Evans says that “these phases are different, and they represent seven ruling regimes and their corresponding rules”. The main capital had four quadrants in which the Templo Mayor stood in the middle. The design of these quadrants reflects the Mexica cosmos that represented of three layers of the universe. The middle layer represented the earthly one inhabited by humans. Above the regions of the humans, the Aztecs imaged the heavens (thirteen levels), Omeyocan, called the “place of duality,” being the uppermost. Below the earthly layer were the nine levels of the underworld (hell). The lowest of these levels were the realm of Mictlantecuhtli, who was the Lord of the Land of the Dead.
    ## ## The Tenochtitlan “presented not only the religious and political aspect of the Aztecs but also their economic prosperity
The Templo Mayor was also the trading center where people exchanged goods such as the cotton, green stones, tobacco, and flowers. The city has large-scale canals that crisscrossed delivering water in different sides of the city. There were also elevated grounds that were suitable for agriculture. The canals did not only supply the city and the temple with waters but also acted as relieve chambers during the flood to protect the city from destructive flooding.
The themes expressed in their architecture, specifically the Templo Mayor, as well as their monumental and portable sculptures
    ## The design of the Templo Mayor and its size raises various concerns about the Aztec people and their culture. Some of these concerns are the religion, the cosmology, and the politics. The largest structure in the Tenochtitlan has the two temples that had religious importance to the Aztec people. People were sacrificed at the shrines in these temples. People dedicated too much energy, time, and wealth to the rituals and celebrations. The Aztecs were feeding the gods with the human blood and the heart. The victim’s hearts were ripped out, and the blood drained. The heart was burnt to produce the smoke that the Aztecs believed would reach their gods. After removing the heart, the body (corpse) and the head were thrown to roll down the long staircases.
    The other theme is the cosmology. The various levels of the temple represented the cosmology of the Aztec world. The temple is aligned with cardinal directions with many gates that connect to the road that lead to these directions. These directions also reveal the intersection of thirteen levels of heaven (Topan), nine levels of the underworld (hell) and the world where human lives.
    Lastly, there is the theme of politics. The Spaniards attack in the area led to the destruction of the temple and the other structures of the town. When Spaniards conquered the city, they build their kingdom including the Catholic Church that replaced the Temple Mayor. The seven phases of constructions represent the seven regimes with their corresponding the Aztec’s leaders
Conclusion
    Although the Spaniards destroyed the temple and almost everything in the city, the archeologist still finds large collections of the temple’s treasure laying below the areas that temple was erected. It is believed that there are so many treasures lying underground where the cathedral church stands.</p>
